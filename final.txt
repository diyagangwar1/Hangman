Now that I'm actually done, I can say that I wasted too much time writing this code BUT
I am proud of my efforts.

The game I executed is Hangman.
The game works exactly as the actual Wikipedia definition of Hangman.

In my game, when the user chooses to play one round of the game. The user first inputs a word and the computer (AI)
would randomly use letters.
Then the comp inputs a word (hidden) and the user is required to guess letters.
After that the score keeping takes place.

Users can play,load and save the game. 
This game has potential to become better but I'm done for now.
